Automatic semi-colon insertion

Curly braces - pop up to same line to avoid issues with return statements and auto sem-colon insertion

Equals == operator will try and convert the two types it is operating on to be the same
If use === operator then there is no auto type conversion on equality
Rule -
Generally use triple equals not double equals operator

To check if an object exists use 
if(typeof x !== 'undefined'){
   // do something useful
}
